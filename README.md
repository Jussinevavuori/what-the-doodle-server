# What the Doodle?

[Play what the doodle](https://what-the-doodle-client.vercel.app/)

What the Doodle is a simple and fun party-game for preferably 4 - 8 eight people. Get together on an online call and start drawing. Each player gets to choose a starting topic from several random topics or comes up with their own topic. All players will then draw their topics and the next player gets to guess what the previous player drew and the next player gets to draw the guess. The game proceeds on and on in multiple rounds with people guessing what the previous player drew and the next player drawing the guess until the original topic is long lost and the players are tasked with the difficult task of recognizing which drawing is a representation of their starting topic.

The application was built as a quick and fun sideproject using React and WebSockets.
